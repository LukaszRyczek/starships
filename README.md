## Introduction

**Onchain Wars** is an experimental Web3 gaming ecosystem centered around fair, skill-based competition, powered by deflationary tokenomics. Our mission is to deliver competitive, on-chain games where every battle is meaningful, every token matters, and every loss leaves a mark on the circulating supply.

> **There are no shortcuts, no whales, and no endless emissions. The battlefield is unforgiving.**

---

## Tokenomics

**Token Symbol:** `$CLASH`  
**Total Supply:** `1,000,000,000` (1 Billion)  
**Developer Allocation:** **3%** (30,000,000 tokens)  
**Community Allocation:** **97%**  
**Vesting:** _None_  
**Team/VC Allocations:** _None_  
**Ownership:** 100% decentralized.  
**Initial Distribution:** Fair-launch, transparent, with no premines or locked bags.

### Deflationary Model

- **No inflationary emissions:** The supply is capped at launch and only decreases through play.
- **Every defeat fuels deflation:** Losing in-game burns tokens forever.

**The $CLASH token’s fate is decided on-chain, in battle.**

---

## Game Economy & Reward System

Onchain Wars implements a **skill-to-earn** model.  
Tokens are not simply given away — they must be fought for, won, or lost on the battlefield.

**Game Entry:**
- Players stake $CLASH to enter competitive games or duels.

**Outcomes:**
- Victory is rewarded with the lion’s share of all staked tokens.
- Defeat means partial (or total) loss, with a significant portion burned on-chain.

### Reward Distribution (Per Match)

| Action                   | % of Staked Tokens | Details                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Winner (Payout)          | 80%                | Sent directly to the winner     |
| Permanent Burn           | 15%                | Burned (irreversible supply cut)|
| Project Treasury         | 5%                 | For ecosystem & future dev      |

- **No farming. No passive income. All value is generated through risk and gameplay.**
- **Treasury funds are transparent and managed via on-chain governance (coming soon).**

---

## Core Game Mechanics

- **Staking:** All players stake $CLASH to participate in a match.
- **Skill-based Outcomes:** Winners are decided solely by gameplay performance — no RNG, no pay-to-win mechanics.
- **Burn Mechanism:** Each match reduces token supply, permanently deflating $CLASH.
- **Zero Vesting/VC Dumping:** Only active participants benefit. No hidden allocations.

**Every action on Onchain Wars leaves a mark on the token’s supply curve.**

## Ecosystem Games

### 1. **Starship Wars** 🚀

- **Genre:** Real-time PvP space shooter.
- **Gameplay:** Players pilot customizable starships in live, skill-based battles.
- **Mechanics:**  
  - Direct duels and free-for-all arenas.
  - Earn $CLASH by defeating opponents.
  - Losers' staked tokens are burned, winner claims the rest.
- **Status:** Beta version launching soon.

### 2. **Crypto Bubbles** ⚪

- **Inspired by:** Agario, but designed for on-chain PvP.
- **Gameplay:**  
  - Each player controls a bubble.
  - Consume smaller players, grow in size, and survive.
  - Every time you devour another bubble, you claim their staked $CLASH.
  - When you are eliminated, your tokens are instantly burned — no mercy.
- **Objective:** Outlast the competition, accumulate $CLASH, and reduce circulating supply through survival.

## Vision & Roadmap

**Onchain Wars is more than a game — it’s a vision for the next evolution of Web3 gaming.**

### Key Pillars

- **Deflationary Ecosystem:**  
  All games in Onchain Wars enforce token burns. No inflation, no endless handouts. $CLASH becomes scarcer over time.
- **Skill-Driven:**  
  No "pay-to-win", no “idle yield”. Only gameplay ability determines earnings.
- **Continuous Development:**  
  New games, features, and competitive modes shipped frequently.
- **Community Governance:**  
  The future of the platform will be decided by the most active participants.

### Roadmap Highlights

- [x] Token Launch & Fair Distribution
- [x] Mainnet Deployment & Audited Contracts
- [x] Starship Wars Beta Release
- [ ] Crypto Bubbles Game Launch
