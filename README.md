## Introduction

**Onchain Wars** is an experimental Web3 gaming ecosystem centered around fair, skill-based competition, powered by deflationary tokenomics. Our mission is to deliver competitive, on-chain games where every battle is meaningful, every token matters, and every loss leaves a mark on the circulating supply.

> **There are no shortcuts, no whales, and no endless emissions. The battlefield is unforgiving.**

---

## Tokenomics

**Total Supply:** `1,000,000,000` (1 Billion)  
**Developer Allocation:** **1.5 - 3%** (depends on DEV buy)  
**Community Allocation:** **97%**  
**Vesting:** _None_  
**Team/VC Allocations:** _None_  
**Ownership:** 100% decentralized.  
**Initial Distribution:** Fair-launch, transparent, with no premines or locked bags.

### Deflationary Model

- **No inflationary emissions:** The supply is capped at launch and only decreases through play.
- **Every defeat fuels deflation:** Losing in-game burns tokens forever.

**The token’s fate is decided on-chain, in battle.**

---

## Game Economy & Reward System

Onchain Wars implements a **skill-to-earn** model.  
Tokens are not simply given away — they must be fought for, won, or lost on the battlefield.

**Game Entry:**
- Players enter by contributing our native token to the pool, which goes to the winner.

**Outcomes:**
- Victory is rewarded with the lion’s share of all contributed tokens.
- Defeat means partial (or total) loss, with a significant portion burned on-chain.

### Reward Distribution (Per Match)

| Action                   | % of Contributed Tokens | Details                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Winner (Payout)          | 90%                     | Sent directly to the winner     |
| Permanent Burn           | 10%                     | Burned (irreversible supply cut)|

- **No farming. No passive income. All value is generated through risk and gameplay.**
- **Treasury funds are transparent and managed via on-chain governance (coming soon).**

---

## Core Game Mechanics

- **Contribution:** All players enter by adding our native token to the match pool, which goes to the winner.
- **Skill-based Outcomes:** Victory goes to the one who survives the fight.
- **Burn Mechanism:** Each match reduces token supply, permanently deflating our token.
- **Zero Vesting/VC Dumping:** Only active participants benefit. No hidden allocations.

**Every action on Onchain Wars leaves a mark on the token’s supply curve.**

## Vision & Roadmap

**Onchain Wars is more than a gaming platform — it’s a vision for the next evolution of Web3 gaming.**

### Key Pillars

- **Deflationary Ecosystem:**  
  All games in Onchain Wars enforce token burns. No inflation, no endless handouts. Our native token becomes scarcer over time.

- **Skill-Driven:**  
  No "pay-to-win", no “idle yield”. Only gameplay ability determines earnings.

- **Continuous Development:**  
  New games, features, and competitive modes shipped frequently.

- **Community Governance:**  
  The future of the platform will be decided by the most active participants.

**Launch Strategy and Development Plan**

In the first half of **July 2025**, we will launch our native token, along with the release of our first game, **Crypto Commando**, initially in an *off-chain* version. This approach allows us to test player reception, identify and fix bugs, and collect valuable feedback **before players begin wagering tokens in-game**.

In the **second half of July**, we plan to implement Solana Web3 integration in the game. This will enable wallet connections and allow players to fund their in-game accounts with our token. Players will be able to compete for real stakes — contributing tokens to a shared pool, with the winner taking the prize.  

At this stage, the core gameplay mode will be **fair match**, where all players have equal chances. There is no pay-to-win progression: character upgrades are limited to temporary in-game drops or choosing one of six weapon types in the menu. These weapons can be obtained using diamonds earned in gameplay — by defeating AI opponents or winning matches.  

Currently, diamonds serve purely as **off-chain in-game currency**.

The next development step is planned for **August 2025**, when we will implement NFT assets in the game — including new characters and weapons. This will introduce a new mode called **open match**, where all players can join regardless of upgrades, but there is potential to face stronger opponents who hold NFT-based enhancements.  

Additionally, by the end of August, we plan to release **Crypto Commando** on both the **App Store** and **Google Play**.  

Finally, **September 2025 and beyond** will focus on developing new games in the ecosystem and expanding to other chains, such as **Polygon** and **BNB Chain**.

## Security, Transparency & Governance

- **Open Source:** All smart contracts and core code are verifiable and open for audit.
- **No Hidden Admin Keys:** 100% non-custodial, no ability for developers to withdraw or freeze funds.
- **Treasury Transparency:** All treasury flows viewable on-chain.
- **Planned DAO:** Future governance and upgrades to be voted on by native token holders.
